#the-god-formula

The God formula is a spreadsheet formula, widely considered the greatest ever written. It solves a problem that is seemingly impossible (without resorting to hacks) with the spectacular deployment of the built-in MMULT (matrix multiplication) formula.

The God formula was discovered in late 2012, roughly coinciding with the discovery of the God particle (the Higgs Boson).

The God formula is the analytic continuation of the COUNT formula to tabular data, counting the number of occurrences of a named range "vector" of N cells in a (M x N) named range "matrix" of M rows and N columns.

"[...] it would be the ultimate triumph of human reason -- for then we should know the mind of God." - Stephen Hawking, A Brief History of Time (p. 193)
